Set a custom regular expression to use when parsing pull request comments for approval.

> Notes:
>
>    - `approve_by_comment` must be enabled to use this.
>    - We recommend starting with `^`, to only match strings at the beginning of a line. In our experience this makes approval more intentional, and also avoids issues with comments via email where previous content may be embedded in a blockquote (`>`) that could otherwise trigger mistaken approval.

#### Examples
Multiple triggers
```yaml
approve_regex: '^(Approved|:shipit:)'
```
